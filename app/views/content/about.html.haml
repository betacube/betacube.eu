    %p
      :plain
        It all started in 2010 when <strong>Charel Buchler</strong> and <strong>Georges Jentgen</strong> first talked about a new idea over Skype.
    %p
      :plain
        The main goal was quite simple: <strong>“Build a community for Developers, Designers and Startups”</strong>. We started developing so many different ideas on how to achieve this. We talked about weekly/monthly <strong>meetups, conferences, barcamps, and more</strong>. We were immediately sure that these ideas could all work. But it was only in the beginning of 2011 that we jump-started our project <strong>Betacube</strong>.
    %p= "We began with some field research. We tried to get an idea of how big this community could become and if there is any interest at all. It was a blast to see all the great reactions to our idea. It was a truly inspiring time."
    %p
      :plain
        We were finally ready to give life to Betacube, thanks to the help from <strong>Christian Biever</strong>. His knowledge on setting up the association helped us keeping our heads clear to focus on our ideas.

        In early 2012 we then started to organize our first event. We decided to go with a <strong>Show and Tell event</strong>. We worked hard to get the first one ready in April. We had limited seats, which were sold out in less then <strong><em>6 hours</em></strong>. It was a huge success and a great start.
    %p
      :plain
        After that we organized our first <strong>meetups</strong>. Those <strong>meetups</strong> are usually held in a bar in Luxembourg City and everyone is welcome to join. It’s a great way to network with like-minded people and have a beer or two.
