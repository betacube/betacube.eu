        We want to educate our community to use new technologies/tools in their development projects and imply some strict but useful methodologies, including <strong>test-driven-development (TDD)</strong>, and tools like <strong>HAML</strong>, <strong>LESS</strong>, <strong>CoffeeScript</strong> and more.
