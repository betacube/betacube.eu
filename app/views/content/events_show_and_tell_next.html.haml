I came up with SELL YOUR MESS, that has even local traditional competitors and the ability to scale beyond the Luxembourgish borders. It is completely trimmed on mobile and social networks, and avoiding similarities to traditional classified ads. It is clearly inspired by Pinterest, Etsy & Instagram, to apply new hype and style to something that exists since the first days of humanity."
