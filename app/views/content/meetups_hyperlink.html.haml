    %p= "Hyperlink, in computing, is a reference to data that you can follow and read. A hyperlink can point to a complete document or to a specific element inside a document. We believe that this paradigm can also be applied to this community of web professionals consisting of web developers, system administrators, designers and more. We believe that every individual is a document full of knowledge, experiences and ideas. Itâ€™s our goal to build the connections, those Hyperlinks, by organising the events you all participated over the last 2 years."
    %p= "The idea of building connections is one of the founding thoughts why we started Betacube. Getting together, networking, sharing knowledge and having a great time."
